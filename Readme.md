The vector dot product (also known as the scalar product) is an operation that takes two vectors and produces a scalar (a single number). It is a fundamental concept in vector mathematics, commonly used in physics and engineering to express the relationship between two vectors in terms of their alignment and magnitude.

***The dot product is calculated as:***
        *a.b=|a||b| cosÎ¸*

~~vector cross product~~
__Vector dot product or Scalar Product__
Some important points:
```
If a.b=0, then angle between a and b is 90.
If a.b=ab, then angle between a and b is 0.
```

**Observations:**
- When angle between a and b is 0 then a.b=|a||b|.
* When angle between a and b is 90 then a.b=0.
+ When angle between a and b is 30 then a.b=|a||b|/2.

# Table
| CROSS PRODUCT | DOT PRODUCT|
| :--- | :--- |
|Product of the magnitude of vector and the sine of the angle in which they subtend each other. |Product of the magnitude of the vectors and the cos of the angle between them.|
| The output is a vector. | The output is a scalar. |

**MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION**
**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n
a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

We can also add colors to the document like `#ffffff` and `#000000`.
